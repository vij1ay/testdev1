# MultiAgent Boilerplate - Orchestrate AI workflows with ReactAgent and modular tools for scalable automation.

## Summary

**MultiAgent Boilerplate is a production-ready framework** for building extensible, tool-driven AI agents. It provides a **ReactAgent Orchestrator** for managing conversational flows, tool interactions, and business logic, with **LangGraph powering the orchestration logic** as a core component. The system is built on **FastAPI for APIs and WebSocket communication, ChromaDB for semantic retrieval, and Redis for state management and checkpointing.**

With the **ReactAgent Orchestrator**, the flow is fully controlled by prompts - from tool calling and validation to enforcing consent and compliance. Adding a new tool or modifying workflows is as simple as updating prompts, making it easier than ever to extend and adapt the system to new requirements.

**The project** is structured so it can run standalone or be plugged into an existing **FastAPI application** with minimal changes, making it highly adaptable. With modular prompts, strict compliance flows, and scalable architecture, it accelerates the development of reliable AI assistants for enterprise use cases.

This project demonstrates a **Customer Journey example**, and can be easily adapted to any organization. Simply update the prompts to reflect company offerings and values, enrich case studies and testimonials with your own data, and you’ll have a **live chatbot ready to interact with customers** and even book appointments by integrating scheduling tools with your calendar.

## Features

- **AI Agent Orchestration:** Modular agents automate onboarding, expert matching, appointment scheduling, and customer engagement.
- **Tool Integration:** Agents interact with tools for onboarding, specialist search, appointment booking, case studies, testimonials, and conversation summarization.
- **Extensible Prompts:** System prompts enforce business rules, consent protocols, and summarization logic.
- **Strict Protocol Enforcement:** Implements mandatory consent, ID management, and summarization protocols for compliance and reliability.
- **Semantic Search:** ChromaDB powers semantic retrieval of case studies and testimonials.
- **State Management:** Redis-backed state and checkpointing for robust session handling.
- **WebSocket Real-Time Communication:** FastAPI WebSocket endpoints for live chat and event streaming.
- **Production-Grade Logging:** Centralized, structured logging for traceability.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   - Create a `.env` file with required keys (OpenAI, Google, Redis, etc.).
   - Modify config in `config.py` for company-specific settings (CompanyName, ChatbotName, etc.).

3. **Populate vector databases:**
    - Add Case Studies and Testimonials to ChromaDB by placing JSON/txt files in the `casestudies/` and `testimonials/` directories respectively and populate by running:
   ```bash
   python populate_casestudies.py
   python populate_testimonials.py
   ```

---

## Running the Application

1. **Start the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   python fastapi_app.py
   ```

2. **Access the chat interface:**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`
