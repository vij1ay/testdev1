  "detailed_solution": "Evasion Tech conducted a stress test of the client\u2019s e-commerce infrastructure to identify weak points. AWS Auto Scaling was introduced to dynamically adjust resources during traffic surges. CloudFront CDN accelerated content delivery, ensuring global reach. The monolithic checkout process was broken into serverless microservices for fault tolerance. A caching layer reduced latency, and observability tools enabled real-time performance tracking. Together, these changes created a resilient architecture capable of withstanding extreme load conditions.",
